This is a repository for storing build scripts related to Fluidity which are
specific to a given system. It is primarily intended for multi-user systems,
but where esoteric configurations exist for standalone systems which might be
useful to the wider community as examples of setting up a build in an unusual
environment, please feel free to add them here.

Directory layout should follow the fully-qualified name of the system, stacked
in reverse order, i.e. scripts for 'cluster1.foo.org' would go in the
directory:

 <base>/org/foo/cluster1/

Note that since this is branched from the Fluidity trunk to remain in the same
repository-space you will probably want to do a --lightweight checkout of this
branch to avoid inheriting the full Fluidity trunk history.
