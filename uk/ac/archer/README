# User notes for Fluidity on ARCHER
#
###############################################################################

This directory contains scripts to help users build and run Fluidity on Archer,
the UK's Tier 1 HPC. Given the early stage of operation there may well still be
bugs in these scripts; feedback to tim.greaves@imperial.ac.uk would be greatly
appreciated if you encounter any problems.

 * PrgEnv-fluidity : a customised module for Fluidity users which should be
     placed into a privatemodules/ directory in the user's home directory.

 * compile.pbs : a PBS script which needs to be edited to set the user's 
     project code, work directory, and fluidity source directory, and which
     can then be submitted as a job to build that fluidity source.

 * top_hat.pbs : a PBS script which needs to be edited to set the user's
     project code, work directory, and built fluidity directory, provided as an
     example for running a fluidity job on Archer and written to be dropped in
     to the top_hat example directory in a built fluidity source tree.

BE AWARE: as of this documentation, the anaconda module contains TCL libraries
which conflict with those used by the Archer environment modules, so it is not
recommended to place any module commands in scripts after the PrgEnv-fluidity
module has been loaded and the anaconda library path added to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
